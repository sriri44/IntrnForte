1. What is NumPy? Why should we use it?
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library in Python for scientific computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. NumPy is highly efficient for numerical computations due to its underlying C implementation, making it significantly faster than standard Python lists.

Reasons to use NumPy:

Performance: NumPy arrays are more compact and faster than lists due to optimized C code.
Ease of use: Provides an array object and functions to work with arrays.
Functionality: Offers numerous mathematical, logical, and statistical functions.
Interoperability: Works well with other libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
2. Why is NumPy preferred over Matlab, Octave, Idl, or Yorick?
Advantages of NumPy:

Open-source and free: Unlike Matlab, NumPy is free and open-source.
Integration with Python: NumPy can be easily integrated with other Python libraries and tools.
Community and support: NumPy has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation and support.
Flexibility: Python's syntax is more flexible and easier to learn than Matlab.
Extensibility: Can extend functionality with Python, which has a wide range of libraries for various tasks.
3. How are NumPy arrays better than Python’s lists?
Efficiency: NumPy arrays consume less memory and are faster due to contiguous memory allocation and optimized C operations.
Convenience: Provides a vast number of functions for operations on arrays.
Functionality: Supports multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Python lists are only one-dimensional.
Broadcasting: Allows for element-wise operations and broadcasting, which is more cumbersome with lists.
Consistency: Ensures homogeneous data types, while lists can have mixed types which can lead to errors and inefficiencies.
4. What are ways of creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays in NumPy?

import numpy as np

# 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# 3D array
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
5. How do you find the data type of the elements stored in the NumPy arrays?

dtype = arr_1d.dtype
print(dtype)
6. How can you reverse a NumPy array?

# Reversing a 1D array
reversed_arr_1d = arr_1d[::-1]

# Reversing a 2D array along the first axis
reversed_arr_2d = arr_2d[::-1]

# Reversing a 2D array along the second axis
reversed_arr_2d_along_axis1 = arr_2d[:, ::-1]
7. How do we check for an empty array (or zero elements array)?

is_empty = arr_1d.size == 0
print(is_empty)
8. How is arr[:,0] different from arr[:,[0]]?
arr[:, 0] selects all rows and the first column, returning a 1D array.
arr[:, [0]] selects all rows and the first column, returning a 2D array with one column.
9. How do you multiply 2 NumPy array matrices?

# Element-wise multiplication
element_wise_product = np.multiply(arr1, arr2)

# Matrix multiplication
matrix_product = np.dot(arr1, arr2)
10. How do you concatenate 2 NumPy arrays?

# Concatenate along an existing axis
concatenated_array_axis0 = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2), axis=0)
concatenated_array_axis1 = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2), axis=1)

# Concatenate along a new axis
concatenated_array_new_axis = np.stack((arr1, arr2), axis=0)
11. How do you convert Pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array?
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]})

# Convert to NumPy array
numpy_array = df.to_numpy()
12. What do you understand by Vectorization in NumPy?
Vectorization refers to the process of performing operations on entire arrays rather than on individual elements. This is achieved through optimized, low-level implementations in NumPy, allowing for significant performance improvements due to minimized loop overhead and taking advantage of CPU-level parallelism.

Example
# Vectorized operation
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
squared_arr = arr ** 2  # Squaring each element in the array
Vectorization leads to more concise, readable, and efficient code compared to traditional looping methods.
