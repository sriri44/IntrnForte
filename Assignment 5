Q1: What is Seaborn?
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn simplifies complex visualizations with fewer lines of code and integrates well with Pandas data structures.

Q2: What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is highly customizable and serves as the foundation for many other plotting libraries, including Seaborn.

Q3: Does Seaborn need Matplotlib?
Yes, Seaborn requires Matplotlib. Seaborn is essentially an abstraction layer on top of Matplotlib, making it easier to create complex plots with simpler code.

Q4: How can we see all of the datasets available in the Seaborn library?
You can view all the datasets available in Seaborn by using the seaborn.get_dataset_names() function. Here's an example:
import seaborn as sns
print(sns.get_dataset_names())
Q5: What is CMAP in Seaborn?
CMAP refers to colormap, which is a range of colors used in plots to map data values to colors. In Seaborn, colormaps can be used to enhance the visual appeal and clarity of plots.

Q6: What is the Seaborn function for coloring plots?
Seaborn offers several functions for coloring plots, with color_palette() being one of the primary functions. You can specify a colormap or a list of colors using this function.

Q7: What is a Histogram in Seaborn?
A histogram in Seaborn is a plot that shows the distribution of a dataset. It divides the data into bins and displays the frequency of data points in each bin. This helps in understanding the underlying frequency distribution of the data.

Q8: How do you plot a histogram in Seaborn?
You can plot a histogram in Seaborn using the sns.histplot() function. Here's an example:


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = sns.load_dataset("iris")
sns.histplot(data['sepal_length'])
plt.show()
Q9: How to change the minimum number of ticks of MaxNLocator in Seaborn?
To change the minimum number of ticks using MaxNLocator in Seaborn, you need to use Matplotlib's MaxNLocator directly. Here's an example:


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator

# Example plot
sns.histplot(data['sepal_length'])
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(integer=True, min_n_ticks=5))
plt.show()
Q10: How to put a PNG image like a watermark on a line plot in Seaborn?
You can add a PNG image as a watermark to a Seaborn plot by using Matplotlib's figure.figimage() or Axes.imshow(). Here's an example:


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

# Example plot
sns.lineplot(x=[0, 1, 2], y=[0, 1, 4])

# Load and place the image
img = mpimg.imread('path/to/image.png')
plt.imshow(img, extent=[0.5, 1.5, 0, 1], alpha=0.5)

plt.show()
Q11: How to change the legend font size of a FacetGrid plot in Seaborn?
To change the legend font size in a FacetGrid plot, you can access the legend object and modify its properties. Here's an example:


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data and plot
data = sns.load_dataset('tips')
g = sns.FacetGrid(data, col="time", hue="sex")
g.map(sns.scatterplot, "total_bill", "tip")
g.add_legend()
for text in g.legend.texts:
    text.set_fontsize('10')  # Change to desired font size

plt.show()
